# Contributing to sigma-rust-mini

Thanks for wanting to contribute! There are many ways to contribute and we
appreciate any level you're willing to do.

## Process
As a heads up, we'll be running your PR through the following CI jobs:
- warnings turned to compile errors
- `cargo test`
- `rustfmt` (we recommend to setup running `rustfmt` on file save)
- `clippy`
